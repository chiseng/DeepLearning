# Deep Learning Big Project 2020

Project on meta-learning and it's advantages when dealing with few-shot learning. Conducted a small study to see how meta learning fares against off-the-shelf classification libraries. Went on to explore other meta-learning algorithms that can optimise results such as the Reptile Algorithm and Prototypical Network Algorithm, and performed a comparison. Also tried using LSTMs with GLoVE embeddings instead of linear layers with sentence level embeddings within the Reptile Algorithm to see if the type of neural network and embedding affects the accuracy of classification. Implementations for the latter are in this repository.
